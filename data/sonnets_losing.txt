1

From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
But, as the riper should by time decease,
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
  And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
And live no more to shame nor me nor you.
I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
  That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life.
  But if thou live remembered not to be,
Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,

2

When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days,
In other accents do this praise confound
And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
With mine own weakness being best acquainted,
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
  But thou art all my art and dost advance
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
  The worst was this: my love was my decay.
  That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.

3

Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
Now is the time that face should form another,
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
  Ah, but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.
  Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
Unless thou take that honor from thy name.
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
  I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,
Than think that we before have heard them told.
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
Of their fair subject, blessing every book.

4

Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?
Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
Sland'ring creation with a false esteem.
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!
  And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
  This wish I have, then ten times happy me.
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness
Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang.
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove.
Which should example where your equal grew?

5

Those hours that with gentle work did frame
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
Will play the tyrants to the very same
To make some special instant special blessed
How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made
Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,
  And more, much more, than in my verse can sit
My bonds in thee are all determinate.
So, either by thy picture or my love,
  Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;
To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes
  O, learn to read what silent love hath writ.
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,

6

Then let not winter's ragged hand deface
In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled.
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
How would thy shadow's form form happy show
Incertainties now crown themselves assured,
In gentle numbers time so idly spent;
When other petty griefs have done their spite,
Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
To every hymn that able spirit affords
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,
Be where you list, your charter is so strong
They look into the beauty of thy mind,
  For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
No shape so true, no truth of such account,

7

Lo, in the orient when the gracious light
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
Making his style admired everywhere.
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
That overgoes my blunt invention quite,
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
And husband nature's riches from expense;
But that thou none lov'st is most evident.
Without accusing you of injury.
The most sweet favor or deformed'st creature,

8

Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.
Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait
Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,
He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word
In other accents do this praise confound
Utt'ring bare truth, even so as foes commend.
  Even that your pity is enough to cure me.
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
  And thence this slander as I think proceeds.
And the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,

9

Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye
That thou consum'st thyself in single life?
Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
  But weep to have that which it fears to lose.
That I might see what the old world could say
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
Beated and chopped with tanned antiquity,
O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
And keep invention in a noted weed,
  Were to import forgetfulness in me.
For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
  His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
Or any of these all, or all, or more,

10

For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any,
Who for thyself art so unprovident.
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
"Had my friend's muse grown with this growing age,
Th' imprisoned absence of your liberty,
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
  To this I witness call the fools of time,
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
  Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.
But, for their virtue only is their show,
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace.
Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,
For compound sweet forgoing simple savor,

11

As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st
In one of thine, from that which thou departest;
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes;
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
To tie up envy, evermore enlarged.
But yet be blamed if thou thyself deceivest
Who plead for love and look for recompense
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found:
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
Against that time do I ensconce me here
For since each hand hath put on nature's power,
Without thy help, by me be borne alone.

12

When I do count the clock that tells the time
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,
When I behold the violet past prime
That's for thyself to breed another thee,
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,
Which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
  Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.
Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,
Fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face,
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.
Save where you are how happy you make those.
To the clear day with thy much clearer light
  Lo, thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,

13

O, that you were your self! But, love, you are
No longer yours than you yourself here live;
Against this coming end you should prepare,
  Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go."
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
  Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.
Great princes' favorites their fair leaves spread
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,
And given grace a double majesty.
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,

14

Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck,
And yet methinks I have astronomy--
But not to tell of good or evil luck,
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,
  Lest the wise world should look into your moan
For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee
Dark'ning thy power to lend base subjects light?
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
  Receiving nought by elements so slow
Give salutation to my sportive blood?
For why should others' false adulterate eyes
  Die single, and thine image dies with thee.
  Where I may not remove nor be removed.

15

When I consider everything that grows
Holds in perfection but a little moment,
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
And by and by clean starved for a look;
And when a woman woos, what woman's son
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes;
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse,
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
Until life's composition be recured
And yet this time removed was summer's time,
  That all the world besides methinks are dead.

16

But wherefore do not you a mightier way
Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time,
And fortify yourself in your decay
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
  As high as learning my rude ignorance.
I tell the day to please him thou art bright
  But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
And the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand.
Called to that audit by advised respects;
  For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.
Increasing store with loss and loss with store;
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait

17

Who will believe my verse in time to come
If it were filled with your most high deserts?
Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand.
  Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take
But, out alack, he was but one hour mine;
When summer's breath their masked buds discloses;
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
So you o'ergreen my bad, my good allow?
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;

18

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,
  The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.
And though they be outstripped by every pen,
O, fearful meditation! Where, alack,
  When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.
Hearing you praised, I say "'Tis so, 'tis true,"
  To keep an adjunct to remember thee
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,
And do not drop in for an afterloss.
For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;

19

Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws
And make the Earth devour her own sweet brood;
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
Although I swear it to myself alone.
All these I better in one general best.
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,
  And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard;
A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;
Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.
To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
  Hence, thou suborned informer; a true soul

20

A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted
Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
  O, none but unthrifts, dear my love, you know.
O, what excuse will my poor beast then find
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
  Let them say more that like of hearsay well;
So far from home into my deeds to pry,
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
The prey of worms, my body being dead,
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
Why should he live, now Nature bankrout is,

21

So is it not with me as with that muse
Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
To the clear day with thy much clearer light
Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
Kind is my love today, tomorrow kind,
To linger out a purposed overthrow.
The other as your bounty doth appear,
Which eyes not yet created shall o'erread;
I see their antique pen would have expressed
To live a second life on second head,
  Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
  But do not so. I love thee in such sort

22

My glass shall not persuade me I am old
So long as youth and thou are of one date,
But when in thee Time's furrows I behold,
Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
My saucy bark, inferior far to his,
  All this the world well knows, yet none knows well
  For that same groan doth put this in my mind:
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And in this change is my invention spent,
Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
Beauty no pencil beauty's truth to lay;
Cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky,
  Hence, thou suborned informer; a true soul
Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,

23

As an unperfect actor on the stage
Who with his fear is put beside his part,
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
  For nothing this wide universe I call,
Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,
  Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.
  So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon,
Of others' voices that my adder's sense
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
Kind is my love today, tomorrow kind,
In so profound abysm I throw all care
But he that writes of you, if he can tell

24

Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled
Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;
It is so grounded inward in my heart.
Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
Spending again what is already spent.
So dost thou too, and therein dignified.
More sharp to me than spurring to his side;
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing
When rocks impregnable are not so stout

25

Let those who are in favor with their stars
Of public honor and proud titles boast,
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,
  And, all in war with Time for love of you,
My spirit is thine, the better part of me.
And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence.
Against thy reasons making no defense.
  Not blame your pleasure, be it ill or well.
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;
  For nothing this wide universe I call,
  Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour

26

Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,
To thee I send this written embassage
And do not drop in for an afterloss.
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.
So far from home into my deeds to pry,
Pointing to each his thunder, rain, and wind,
For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate
Like widowed wombs after their lords' decease.
  And that thou teachest how to make one twain
And my sick muse doth give another place.
That thou among the wastes of time must go,
Making no summer of another's green,
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know

27

Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired,
But then begins a journey in my head
The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
And yet this time removed was summer's time,
But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,
O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out
Beated and chopped with tanned antiquity,
And by and by clean starved for a look;
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
For never-resting time leads summer on
And every humor hath his adjunct pleasure,
If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!

28

How can I then return in happy plight
That am debarred the benefit of rest,
When day's oppression is not eased by night,
  But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
  And that is this, and this with thee remains.
  This told, I joy; but then, no longer glad,
To linger out a purposed overthrow.
If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
That you for love speak well of me untrue,
Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing;
And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,
Although thou steal thee all my poverty;

29

When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
I all alone beweep my outcast state,
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
Even in the eyes of all posterity
It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish.
  Kill me with spites, yet we must not be foes.
My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life.
And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
These blenches gave my heart another youth,
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.
When love, converted from the thing it was,
And being frank, she lends to those are free.

30

When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past,
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
  Ah, but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,
To mar the subject that before was well?
  Receiving nought by elements so slow
  For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.
  All this away, and me most wretched make.
Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
  Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.
Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.

31

Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
Which I by lacking have supposed dead,
And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,
  By praising him here who doth hence remain.
  And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defense
But love for love thus shall excuse my jade:
Before the golden tresses of the dead,
O, no. Thy love, though much, is not so great.
O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,

32

If thou survive my well-contented day
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,
And shalt by fortune once more resurvey
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write
For if you were by my unkindness shaken
Feeds on the rarities of Nature's truth,
  Receiving nought by elements so slow
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
  Die single, and thine image dies with thee.
Though to itself it only live and die;
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
Most true it is that I have looked on truth

33

Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
Nor thou with public kindness honor me
Him in thy course untainted do allow
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
Pointing to each his thunder, rain, and wind,
  To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
Or, being wracked, I am a worthless boat,
It fears not policy, that heretic
And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,
The world will be thy widow and still weep

34

Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
And make me travel forth without my cloak,
To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
Which should example where your equal grew?
Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang.
Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
Askance and strangely; but by all above,
  I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.
  Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,

35

No more be grieved at that which thou hast done.
Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
Which proves more short than waste or ruining?
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;
The prey of worms, my body being dead,
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.
Even in the eyes of all posterity
Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
  Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.

36

Let me confess that we two must be twain
Although our undivided loves are one;
So shall those blots that do with me remain,
O, let me, true in love, but truly write,
Made old offenses of affections new.
For to no other pass my verses tend
  This were to be new made when thou art old
The earth can have but earth, which is his due;
And live no more to shame nor me nor you.
To linger out a purposed overthrow.
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;
For you in me can nothing worthy prove;

37

As a decrepit father takes delight
To see his active child do deeds of youth,
So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,
They look into the beauty of thy mind,
Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;
And in some perfumes is there more delight
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odors made.
That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
Excuse not silence so, for 't lies in thee
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
For thou no farther than my thoughts canst move,

38

How can my muse want subject to invent
While thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse
Thine own sweet argument, too excellent
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
The one by toil, the other to complain
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand.
In many's looks, the false heart's history
Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
The right of sepulchers, were shorn away
Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,
To critic and to flatterer stopped are.

39

O, how thy worth with manners may I sing
When thou art all the better part of me?
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring,
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
The scope and tenor of thy jealousy?
  And even thence thou wilt be stol'n, I fear,
Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,
It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
  Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.
  To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,
Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
To tie up envy, evermore enlarged.
So that eternal love in love's fresh case

40

Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all.
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
Thy adverse party is thy advocate--
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;
And for that riches where is my deserving?
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
Look what thy memory cannot contain
Making lascivious comments on thy sport,
I was not sick of any fear from thence.
They look into the beauty of thy mind,
  My most true mind thus maketh mine eye untrue.

41

Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits
When I am sometime absent from thy heart,
Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,
Why write I still all one, ever the same,
  Which three till now never kept seat in one.
If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;
  The hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge.
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
  Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe,
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,
  And mock you with me after I am gone.
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?

42

That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
Without thy help, by me be borne alone.
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew.
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
Like widowed wombs after their lords' decease.
Too base of thee to be remembered.
Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.
  Unless this general evil they maintain:
And steal dead seeing of his living hue?
  In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,

43

When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,
For all the day they view things unrespected;
But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee
Past reason hunted, and no sooner had,
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish.
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
And beauty slandered with a bastard shame.
Either not assailed, or victor being charged;
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;
  Painting my age with beauty of thy days.
Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
Naming thy name blesses an ill report.
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,

44

If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
Injurious distance should not stop my way,
For then, despite of space, I would be brought
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
  As with your shadow I with these did play.
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
And gilded honor shamefully misplaced,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
  Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
  Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee.
No, I am that I am; and they that level
You are my all the world, and I must strive

45

The other two, slight air and purging fire,
Are both with thee, wherever I abide;
The first my thought, the other my desire,
If I could write the beauty of your eyes
So all my best is dressing old words new,
Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up.
Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake,
But let your love even with my life decay,
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?

46

Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
How to divide the conquest of thy sight.
Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
Could make me any summer's story tell,
In winged speed no motion shall I know.
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;
That you yourself, being extant, well might show
Who lead thee in their riot even there
  Or gluttoning on all, or all away.
For you in me can nothing worthy prove;
Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,
  And thence this slander as I think proceeds.

47

Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
And each doth good turns now unto the other.
When that mine eye is famished for a look,
O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
To 'cide this title is impaneled
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
And stretched meter of an antique song.
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie.
  For that same groan doth put this in my mind:
That overgoes my blunt invention quite,
But best is best if never intermixed"?
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
And when a woman woos, what woman's son

48

How careful was I, when I took my way,
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
That to my use it might unused stay
My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good.
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
Nor thou with public kindness honor me
Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
The bounteous largess given thee to give?

49

Against that time, if ever that time come,
When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
Whenas thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell.
And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure.
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,
On purpose laid to make the taker mad.
When sparkling stars twire not, thou gild'st the even.
But that thou none lov'st is most evident.
Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.

50

How heavy do I journey on the way,
When what I seek, my weary travel's end,
Doth teach that ease and that repose to say
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,
Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
  All this the world well knows, yet none knows well
  This were to be new made when thou art old
  And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defense
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
Since mind at first in character was done,
  You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.
And die as fast as they see others grow;
Could make me any summer's story tell,

51

Thus can my love excuse the slow offense
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:
From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?
Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
  And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.
These present-absent with swift motion slide.
Save what is had or must from you be took.
But shoot not at me in your wakened hate,
Never believe, though in my nature reigned
Of different flowers in odor and in hue
Though to itself it only live and die;
To 'cide this title is impaneled

52

So am I as the rich whose blessed key
Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
The which he will not ev'ry hour survey,
Who lead thee in their riot even there
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss.
Or say with princes if it shall go well
  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
The world will be thy widow and still weep
Utt'ring bare truth, even so as foes commend.
But mutual render, only me for thee.
When in the least of them my life hath end;
Thy love is better than high birth to me,
Shall reasons find of settled gravity;

53

What is your substance, whereof are you made,
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
Since everyone hath, every one, one shade,
In other accents do this praise confound
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
And I by this will be a gainer too;
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good.
And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
  Or else of thee this I prognosticate:
  Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
And all those beauties whereof now he's king
And soon to you as you to me then tendered
Why should false painting imitate his cheek
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard;

54

O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee;
Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
Even in the eyes of all posterity
Exceeded by the height of happier men.
  Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.
The basest weed outbraves his dignity.
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
That I might see what the old world could say
And situation with those dancing chips,
By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.
In gentle numbers time so idly spent;

55

Not marble nor the gilded monuments
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
And yet this time removed was summer's time,
Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces."
  All men are bad and in their badness reign.
Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
To tie up envy, evermore enlarged.
The age to come would say "This poet lies;
O, let me, true in love, but truly write,
  All losses are restored and sorrows end.
Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.

56

Sweet love, renew thy force. Be it not said
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
Which but today by feeding is allayed,
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
But all alone stands hugely politic,
Nativity, once in the main of light,
And by addition me of thee defeated
Be thou the tenth muse, ten times more in worth
By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind.
  "Since from thee going he went willful slow,
Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,
And, constant stars, in them I read such art
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
And brought to medicine a healthful state

57

Being your slave, what should I do but tend
Upon the hours and times of your desire?
I have no precious time at all to spend
Return, forgetful muse, and straight redeem
Though I, once gone, to all the world must die.
Without this, folly, age, and cold decay.
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.
  Thine, by thy beauty being false to me.
For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie.
  The constancy and virtue of your love.
Or me, to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;

58

That god forbid, that made me first your slave,
I should in thought control your times of pleasure,
Or at your hand th' account of hours to crave,
  To show false art what beauty was of yore.
Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
And therefore have I slept in your report,
  Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
Against that time do I ensconce me here
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;
  Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
  Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.
If I could write the beauty of your eyes

59

If there be nothing new, but that which is
Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,
Which, laboring for invention, bear amiss
To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury.
  But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.
When love, converted from the thing it was,
  Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.
Or me, to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
And weep afresh love's long since canceled woe,
Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.
Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand;
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

60

Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
So do our minutes hasten to their end,
Each changing place with that which goes before;
Of thee, thy record never can be missed.
Kind is my love today, tomorrow kind,
And precious phrase by all the muses filed.
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
O, lest your true love may seem false in this,
When sparkling stars twire not, thou gild'st the even.
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,
Self so self-loving were iniquity.
  Pity the world, or else this glutton be--
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
Why should he live, now Nature bankrout is,

61

Is it thy will thy image should keep open
My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
And you in Grecian tires are painted new.
Making his style admired everywhere.
A god in love, to whom I am confined.
Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
Whether we are mended, or whe'er better they,
For there can live no hatred in thine eye;
And you and love are still my argument;
  Therefore, like her, I sometime hold my tongue,
From his low tract and look another way.
Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:

62

Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
And all my soul and all my every part;
And for this sin there is no remedy,
Not wond'ring at the present nor the past;
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
  Their images I loved I view in thee,
They live unwooed and unrespected fade,
  This were to be new made when thou art old
Let him but copy what in you is writ,
As on the finger of a throned queen
  But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.
  Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,

63

Against my love shall be, as I am now,
With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn;
When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
  When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.
O, lest your true love may seem false in this,
When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
Too base of thee to be remembered.
To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.
The scope and tenor of thy jealousy?
  And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.

64

When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
  But why thy odor matcheth not thy show,
  And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
For she hath no exchequer now but his,
Thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,
  Kill me with spites, yet we must not be foes.
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
  Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.
The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit

65

Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea
But sad mortality o'ersways their power,
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
And simple truth miscalled simplicity,
That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
And yet this time removed was summer's time,
And brought to medicine a healthful state
So are those errors that in thee are seen
Find no determination; then you were
By looking on thee in the living day,
Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
And that your love taught it this alchemy,

66

Tired with all these, for restful death I cry:
As, to behold desert a beggar born,
And needy nothing trimmed in jollity,
Might I not then say "Now I love you best,"
By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind.
When all the breathers of this world are dead.
And that, in guess, they measure by thy deeds;
To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;
  Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.
As I by yours, you've passed a hell of time,
  Which die for goodness who have lived for crime.
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.

67

Ah, wherefore with infection should he live,
And with his presence grace impiety,
That sin by him advantage should achieve
But in the onset come; so shall I taste
Of faults concealed wherein I am attainted,
But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
But hope of orphans and unfathered fruit;
And make Time's spoils despised everywhere.
Which this time's pencil or my pupil pen
And only herald to the gaudy spring
Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
All men make faults, and even I in this,
Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,

68

Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
Before these bastard signs of fair were borne,
Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,
Which should example where your equal grew?
  Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,
All these I better in one general best.
  To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.
No shape so true, no truth of such account,
And for that riches where is my deserving?
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
O, let me suffer, being at your beck,

69

Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend.
All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,
Make answer, muse. Wilt thou not haply say
Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.
He, nor that affable familiar ghost
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour
  How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me;
Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
And, kept unused, the user so destroys it.
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
  Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,

70

That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,
For slander's mark was ever yet the fair.
The ornament of beauty is suspect,
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
Of thee, thy record never can be missed.
Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.
And do not drop in for an afterloss.
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.
When all the breathers of this world are dead.
Who all their parts of me to thee did give;
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
  And, all in war with Time for love of you,
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.

71

No longer mourn for me when I am dead
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
Give warning to the world that I am fled
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,
They rightly do inherit heaven's graces
But hope of orphans and unfathered fruit;
But that, so much of earth and water wrought,
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray
  As thus: mine eyes' due is thy outward part,
  'Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,
Thyself away are present still with me;
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
Beyond all date, even to eternity--
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,

72

O, lest the world should task you to recite
What merit lived in me that you should love,
After my death, dear love, forget me quite,
  Your own glass shows you when you look in it.
  And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
  Lest the wise world should look into your moan
No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,
Him in thy course untainted do allow
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odors made.
Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
For there can live no hatred in thine eye;
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
Within the knowledge of mine own desert,

73

That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
For compound sweet forgoing simple savor,
  That all the world besides methinks are dead.
That you yourself may privilege your time
Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
Or ten times happier, be it ten for one.
But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
Ah, yet doth beauty, like a dial hand,
He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.

74

But be contented when that fell arrest
Without all bail shall carry me away,
My life hath in this line some interest,
But, for their virtue only is their show,
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;
When thou thyself dost give invention light?
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,
Hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke?
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
  This wish I have, then ten times happy me.
  To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,

75

So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;
And for the peace of you I hold such strife
Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,
Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny,
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
Show me your image in some antique book,
Save that my soul's imaginary sight
Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
Him in thy course untainted do allow

76

Why is my verse so barren of new pride,
So far from variation or quick change?
Why with the time do I not glance aside
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
  But here's the joy: my friend and I are one;
In so profound abysm I throw all care
  And that is this, and this with thee remains.
The world will be thy widow and still weep
And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins,
Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
And, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding.
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.

77

Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;
The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
As on the finger of a throned queen
  But weep to have that which it fears to lose.
And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
  In days long since, before these last so bad.
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
  For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred:
But all alone stands hugely politic,
Utt'ring bare truth, even so as foes commend.
When thou thyself dost give invention light?
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favor

78

So oft have I invoked thee for my muse
And found such fair assistance in my verse
As every alien pen hath got my use
Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins,
"Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend."
And for that riches where is my deserving?
To new-found methods and to compounds strange?
Although thou steal thee all my poverty;
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay
The barren tender of a poet's debt.
Even such a beauty as you master now.
That you yourself may privilege your time
The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits!
Another time mine eye is my heart's guest

79

Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;
But now my gracious numbers are decayed,
As fast as objects to his beams assemble?
And yet love knows it is a greater grief
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
And being frank, she lends to those are free.
For to no other pass my verses tend
  This wish I have, then ten times happy me.
  For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,
O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark
  My most true mind thus maketh mine eye untrue.
Though in our lives a separable spite,
  The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.

80

O, how I faint when I of you do write,
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,
And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
  My most true mind thus maketh mine eye untrue.
Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.
Such civil war is in my love and hate
But heaven in thy creation did decree
My name be buried where my body is
Which should example where your equal grew?
In gentle numbers time so idly spent;
  My love shall in my verse ever live young.
  Pity the world, or else this glutton be--
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell.
For every vulgar paper to rehearse?

81

Or I shall live your epitaph to make
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten.
From hence your memory death cannot take,
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
For it no form delivers to the heart
Seems seeing, but effectually is out;
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
And stops his pipe in growth of riper days.
  Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone.
  Were to import forgetfulness in me.
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense--

82

I grant thou wert not married to my muse,
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
The dedicated words which writers use
Nor shall Death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
  Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.
Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
  My grief lies onward and my joy behind.
  That every tongue says beauty should look so.
  Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.
Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
And so my patent back again is swerving.

83

I never saw that you did painting need
And therefore to your fair no painting set.
I found, or thought I found, you did exceed
Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out
  Be not self-willed, for thou art much too fair
In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
  Their images I loved I view in thee,
For it no form delivers to the heart
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
The other as your bounty doth appear,
And in this change is my invention spent,
  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.

84

Who is it that says most, which can say more
Than this rich praise, that you alone are you,
In whose confine immured is the store
And to the most of praise add something more;
  All losses are restored and sorrows end.
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
  To keep an adjunct to remember thee
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue
  Pity the world, or else this glutton be--
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds.
And to his palate doth prepare the cup.

85

My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still
While comments of your praise, richly compiled,
Reserve their character with golden quill
In other accents do this praise confound
Myself corrupting salving thy amiss,
Creating every bad a perfect best
Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight;
  Your own glass shows you when you look in it.
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
Either not assailed, or victor being charged;
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?

86

Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
Bound for the prize of all-too-precious you,
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
Which husbandry in honor might uphold
A bliss in proof and proved a very woe;
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
When swift extremity can seem but slow?
Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;
  I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.
Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
  The worst was this: my love was my decay.
Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;
By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed.
To him that bears the strong offense's cross.

87

Farewell, thou art too dear for my possessing,
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate.
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
  Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.
Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight;
And to the painted banquet bids my heart.
But these particulars are not my measure;
How can I then be elder than thou art?
Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright,
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favor
Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
Showing their birth and where they did proceed?
Return of love, more blessed may be the view.

88

When thou shalt be disposed to set me light
And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
Upon thy side against myself I'll fight
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
But yet be blamed if thou thyself deceivest
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish.
Have faculty by nature to subsist;
Unlooked for joy in that I honor most.
  O, learn to read what silent love hath writ.
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
You are my all the world, and I must strive
Therefore my verse, to constancy confined,

89

Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
And I will comment upon that offense;
Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt,
To know my shames and praises from your tongue;
Return, forgetful muse, and straight redeem
Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
Self so self-loving were iniquity.
He, nor that affable familiar ghost
The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits!
And our dear love lose name of single one,
Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
  All this the world well knows, yet none knows well
So thou be good, slander doth but approve

90

Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,
Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.
  And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.
  Then others for the breath of words respect,
And yet love knows it is a greater grief
Thus policy in love, t' anticipate
  When most impeached stands least in thy control.
Increasing store with loss and loss with store;
As interest of the dead, which now appear
He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word
They live unwooed and unrespected fade,
Although I swear it to myself alone.

91

Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,
Some in their garments, though newfangled ill,
"Truth needs no color with his color fixed,
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
The bounteous largess given thee to give?
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee
But yet be blamed if thou thyself deceivest
To say they err I dare not be so bold,
To march in ranks of better equipage.
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
What wretched errors hath my heart committed,

92

But do thy worst to steal thyself away,
For term of life thou art assured mine,
And life no longer than thy love will stay,
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
To know my shames and praises from your tongue;
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
I was not sick of any fear from thence.
And only herald to the gaudy spring
And threescore year would make the world away.
  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.
To linger out a purposed overthrow.
So far from home into my deeds to pry,
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
That you are you, so dignifies his story.

93

So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
Like a deceived husband; so love's face
May still seem love to me, though altered new;
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,
The painful warrior famoused for worth,
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue
Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch;
  Lest the wise world should look into your moan
But all alone stands hugely politic,
Within the knowledge of mine own desert,

94

They that have power to hurt and will do none,
That do not do the thing they most do show,
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
That heavy Saturn laughed and leapt with him.
Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
Look whom she best endowed she gave the more,
From limits far remote, where thou dost stay.
Why should false painting imitate his cheek
For no man well of such a salve can speak
Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
For I impair not beauty, being mute,
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven;
That he shall never cut from memory
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted

95

How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;
Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
And that your love taught it this alchemy,
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
  This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
And when a woman woos, what woman's son
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
And broils root out the work of masonry,
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.
The one by toil, the other to complain

96

Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport.
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;
That thou, in losing me, shall win much glory;
Too base of thee to be remembered.
Against confounding age's cruel knife,
  Yet seemed it winter still, and, you away,
And found it in thy cheek. He can afford
Not that the summer is less pleasant now
  But when your countenance filled up his line,
When other petty griefs have done their spite,
  Love is a babe. Then might I not say so,
  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
  Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go."

97

How like a winter hath my absence been
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen,
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
Cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky,
  His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
O, what a happy title do I find,
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
The clear eyes' moiety and the dear heart's part,
The prey of worms, my body being dead,
Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn

98

From you have I been absent in the spring,
When proud-pied April, dressed in all his trim,
Hath put a spirit of youth in everything,
  These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
His tender heir might bear his memory.
  Yet do thy worst, old Time; despite thy wrong,
  And thence this slander as I think proceeds.
  Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love."
For since each hand hath put on nature's power,
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her.
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?

99

Where art thou, muse, that thou forget'st so long
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
And you, but one, can every shadow lend.
When every private widow well may keep,
But, for their virtue only is their show,
If thou couldst answer "This fair child of mine
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.
O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary
  Therefore, like her, I sometime hold my tongue,
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds.
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,
In so profound abysm I throw all care
  Pity the world, or else this glutton be--

100

O truant muse, what shall be thy amends
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
Till Nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,
Within his bending sickle's compass come;
Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink
Might I not then say "Now I love you best,"
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
To make some special instant special blessed
And for myself mine own worth do define
After a thousand victories once foiled,
  Your own glass shows you when you look in it.
Not making worse what nature made so clear,
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;

101

My love is strengthened, though more weak in seeming;
I love not less, though less the show appear.
That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
Though to itself it only live and die;
For, having traffic with thyself alone,
Such civil war is in my love and hate
  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
And do so, love; yet when they have devised
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
That every word doth almost tell my name,
If I could write the beauty of your eyes

102

Alack, what poverty my muse brings forth,
That, having such a scope to show her pride,
The argument all bare is of more worth
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
Are windows to my breast, wherethrough the sun
Which shall be most my glory, being dumb,
That heavy Saturn laughed and leapt with him.
They are but dressings of a former sight.
Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
But hope of orphans and unfathered fruit;
And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;

103

To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure.
Of their fair subject, blessing every book.
So is the time that keeps you as my chest,
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;
That you are you, so dignifies his story.
And to his palate doth prepare the cup.
Making dead wood more blest than living lips.
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
O, let me suffer, being at your beck,
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.

104

Let not my love be called idolatry,
Nor my beloved as an idol show,
Since all alike my songs and praises be
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,
And having thee, of all men's pride I boast.
Without this, folly, age, and cold decay.
For that sweet odor which doth in it live.
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write
Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
  Make thee another self for love of me,
O, no. Thy love, though much, is not so great.
I see a better state to me belongs
Him in thy course untainted do allow
Give salutation to my sportive blood?

105

When in the chronicle of wasted time
I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
To make of monsters and things indigest
Thou best of dearest and mine only care
  To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.
Then of thy beauty do I question make
  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art:
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,
Showing their birth and where they did proceed?
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
When rocks impregnable are not so stout

106

Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come
Can yet the lease of my true love control,
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish;
As the perfumed tincture of the roses,
The clear eyes' moiety and the dear heart's part,
Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived.
  For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait
Not by our feeling but by others' seeing.
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
  All this away, and me most wretched make.

107

What's in the brain that ink may character
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?
What's new to speak, what now to register,
When I was certain o'er incertainty,
Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.
Sland'ring creation with a false esteem.
Self so self-loving were iniquity.
To make some special instant special blessed
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
Making a couplement of proud compare
For compound sweet forgoing simple savor,
Spending again what is already spent.
Whether we are mended, or whe'er better they,
  Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.

108

O, never say that I was false of heart,
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify;
As easy might I from myself depart
  Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.
  As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
Save that my soul's imaginary sight
Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
  Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.
Still losing when I saw myself to win!
For why should others' false adulterate eyes
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
  Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.
  Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,
Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue

109

Alas, 'tis true, I have gone here and there
And made myself a motley to the view,
Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
  And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.
  Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay.
My life, being made of four, with two alone
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
That poor retention could not so much hold,
In so profound abysm I throw all care
When in the least of them my life hath end;
The bounteous largess given thee to give?

110

O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
That did not better for my life provide
Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch;
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
The mountain or the sea, the day or night,
  For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
  Then others for the breath of words respect,
Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;
That music hath a far more pleasing sound.
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,
  All men are bad and in their badness reign.
And in themselves their pride lies buried,
  For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings

111

Your love and pity doth th' impression fill
Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow;
For what care I who calls me well or ill,
  All losses are restored and sorrows end.
  To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.
If Time have any wrinkle graven there.
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
  Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art
This silence for my sin you did impute,
  Where time and outward form would show it dead.
And that your love taught it this alchemy,
To every hymn that able spirit affords

112

Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind,
And that which governs me to go about
Doth part his function, and is partly blind,
And lace itself with his society?
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
The clear eyes' moiety and the dear heart's part,
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
And the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,
For there can live no hatred in thine eye;
O, that our night of woe might have remembered
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
  Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,

113

Or whether doth my mind, being crowned with you,
Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?
Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
And for myself mine own worth do define
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
  This wish I have, then ten times happy me.
Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.
To linger out a purposed overthrow.
From limits far remote, where thou dost stay.
Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing;
  Because I would not dull you with my song.
  Sings this to thee: "Thou single wilt prove none."
Myself corrupting salving thy amiss,

114

Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
Even those that said I could not love you dearer;
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
A god in love, to whom I am confined.
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on
  That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
Showing their birth and where they did proceed?
  And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.
  Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds.
  Where I may not remove nor be removed.

115

Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
  Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,
  You still shall live--such virtue hath my pen--
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.
Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
The hand that writ it, for I love you so
  Incapable of more, replete with you,
  O, none, unless this miracle have might,
  To keep an adjunct to remember thee

116

Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all
Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.
  My most true mind thus maketh mine eye untrue.
Thy adverse party is thy advocate--
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
Be as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
And, proud of many, lives upon his gains?
  Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,
At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
I must each day say o'er the very same,
  I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,

117

Like as to make our appetites more keen
With eager compounds we our palate urge;
As to prevent our maladies unseen
So dost thou too, and therein dignified.
At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand.
  Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.
Or me, to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;
Cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky,
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;
Which parts the shore where two contracted new
Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art
But that thou none lov'st is most evident.
That overgoes my blunt invention quite,

118

What potions have I drunk of siren tears
Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within,
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove.
Leaving thee living in posterity?
Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
  If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.
That use is not forbidden usury
Past reason hunted, and no sooner had,
The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
They look into the beauty of thy mind,
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
  Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.
And haply of our old acquaintance tell.

119

That you were once unkind befriends me now,
And for that sorrow which I then did feel
Needs must I under my transgression bow,
Nay, if you read this line, remember not
Who all their parts of me to thee did give;
  Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe,
For she hath no exchequer now but his,
O, 'tis the first: 'tis flattery in my seeing,
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part.
Within his bending sickle's compass come;
  The worth of that is that which it contains,
No, it was builded far from accident;
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.

120

'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,
When not to be receives reproach of being,
And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven;
It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
So flatter I the swart complexioned night,
Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
  As thus: mine eyes' due is thy outward part,
  And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.
  Make thee another self for love of me,
Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,

121

Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
Full charactered with lasting memory,
Which shall above that idle rank remain
And look upon myself and curse my fate,
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
And do so, love; yet when they have devised
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
  When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.
O, that our night of woe might have remembered
Time's thievish progress to eternity.
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,
And every humor hath his adjunct pleasure,

122

No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change.
Thy pyramids built up with newer might
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
Spending again what is already spent.
And what is 't but mine own when I praise thee?
  Let them say more that like of hearsay well;
Looking on darkness which the blind do see;
In tender embassy of love to thee,
Be thou the tenth muse, ten times more in worth
  Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,
O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out
Rise, resty muse; my love's sweet face survey
  The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,

123

If my dear love were but the child of state,
It might for fortune's bastard be unfathered,
As subject to time's love or to time's hate,
And art made tongue-tied by authority,
How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
I must each day say o'er the very same,
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
  Since why to love I can allege no cause.
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,
  Then happy I, that love and am beloved
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
Now all is done, have what shall have no end.
That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.

124

Were 't aught to me I bore the canopy,
With my extern the outward honoring,
Or laid great bases for eternity,
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.
  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
  Since why to love I can allege no cause.
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;
  And that thou teachest how to make one twain
Consumed with that which it was nourished by.
  As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
And to be praised of ages yet to be.
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell

125

In the old age, black was not counted fair,
Or, if it were, it bore not beauty's name;
But now is black beauty's successive heir,
  Then others for the breath of words respect,
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
Against thy reasons making no defense.
Then of thy beauty do I question make
They look into the beauty of thy mind,
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee.
  Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
The right of sepulchers, were shorn away
  And they shall live, and he in them still green.
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.

126

How oft, when thou, my music, music play'st
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove.
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
And make Time's spoils despised everywhere.
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
  Then others for the breath of words respect,

127

Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame
Is lust in action; and, till action, lust
Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody, full of blame,
From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
Excuse not silence so, for 't lies in thee
But when my glass shows me myself indeed
So should the lines of life that life repair
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
When swift extremity can seem but slow?
  As with your shadow I with these did play.
And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;
Of this our time, all you prefiguring;
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.

128

My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense--
Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
And hang more praise upon deceased I
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch.
Why write I still all one, ever the same,
And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.
That you yourself may privilege your time
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
For at a frown they in their glory die.
  Die single, and thine image dies with thee.
Let him but copy what in you is writ,

129

Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove
That you are you, so dignifies his story.
  Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
Thy adverse party is thy advocate--
